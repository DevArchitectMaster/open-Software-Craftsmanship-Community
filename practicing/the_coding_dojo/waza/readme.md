# Waza

> _Wasa is very much like a two-man kata. The routines are precisely memorized and played back. One partner plays the role of the aggressor, and the other partner is the defender. The motions are repeated over and over again as the practitioners swap roles._   
\--- Robert C. Martin <sup>[[2](../../../docs/reference.md#2), p. 91]</sup>

## Methods

* [Pair Programming Ping Pong Pattern](http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern)
  > _The two partners choose a kata, or a simple problem. One programmer writes a unit test, and then the other must make it pass. Then they reverse roles._
