# the Coding Dojo

> _[...] many programmers have adopted a martial arts metaphor for their practice sessions. The name Coding Dojo seems to have stuck. Sometimes a group of programmers will meet and practice together just like martial artists do. At other times, programmers will practice solo, again as martial artists do. [...] There are several kinds of activities that take place in a dojo._
