# Kata

> _A programming kata is a precise set of choreographed keystrokes and mouse movements that simulates the solving of some programming problem. You arenâ€™t actually solving the problem because you already know the solution. Rather, you are practicing the movements and decisions involved in solving the problem. [...]   
The asymptote of perfection is once again the goal. You repeat the exercise over and over again to train your brain and fingers how to move and react. As you practice you may discover subtle improvements and efficiencies either in your motions or in the solution itself. [...]   
[...] it is a good way to drive common problem/solution pairs into your subconscious, so that you simply know how to solve them when facing them in real programming._
